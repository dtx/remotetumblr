TumblrV2 API for posting in Python, for easier remote posting without having to log in everytime.

This is cirrently under development, and I will try to apply document-as-you-go as I develop and enhance the components.

This is a project mainly concerned with easier posting to Tumblr on machines that run Python > 2.4

This project was inspired from my own observations and some of [velocityzen's](http://www.github.com/velocityzen) gists I came accross online.
